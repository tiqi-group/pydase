# RESTful API

The `pydase` RESTful API allows for standard HTTP-based interactions and provides access to various functionalities through specific routes. This is particularly useful for integrating `pydase` services with other applications or for scripting and automation.

To help developers understand and utilize the API, we provide an OpenAPI specification. This specification describes the available endpoints and corresponding request/response formats.
