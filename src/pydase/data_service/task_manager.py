class TaskManager:
    """
    The TaskManager class is a utility designed to manage asynchronous tasks. It
    provides functionality for starting, stopping, and tracking these tasks. The class
    is primarily used by the DataService class to manage its tasks.

    A task in TaskManager is any asynchronous function. To add a task, you simply need
    to define an async function within your class that extends TaskManager. For example:

    ```python
    class MyService(DataService):
        async def my_task(self):
            # Your task implementation here
            pass
    ```

    With the above definition, TaskManager automatically creates `start_my_task` and
    `stop_my_task` methods that can be used to control the task.

    TaskManager also supports auto-starting tasks. If there are tasks that should start
    running as soon as an instance of your class is created, you can define them in
    `self._autostart_tasks` in your class constructor (__init__ method). Here's how:

    ```python
    class MyService(DataService):
        def __init__(self):
            self._autostart_tasks = {
                "my_task": (*args)  # Replace with actual arguments
            }
            self.wait_time = 1
            super().__init__()

        async def my_task(self, *args):
            while True:
                # Your task implementation here
                await asyncio.sleep(self.wait_time)
    ```

    In the above example, `my_task` will start running as soon as
    `_start_autostart_tasks` is called which is done when the DataService instance is
    passed to the `pydase.Server` class.

    The responsibilities of the TaskManager class are:

    - Track all running tasks: Keeps track of all the tasks that are currently running.
    This allows for monitoring of task statuses and for making sure tasks do not
    overlap.
    - Provide the ability to start and stop tasks: Automatically creates methods to
    start and stop each task.
    - Emit notifications when the status of a task changes: Has a built-in mechanism for
    emitting notifications when a task starts or stops. This is used to update the user
    interfaces, but can also be used to write logs, etc.
